***************************************************************Dart Language Notes************************************************************

A Tour of the Dart Language- https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour
A good amount of the following info is covered in the above link if you want to read for yourself from the source material. 


Enforcing privacy with underscore prefix-      
_identifierName (with the underscore prefix) enforces privacy as dart does not have the keywords
 ‘public’ ‘private’ or ‘protected’ like Java. For details, see https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#libraries-and-visibility

Ternary Operator ('?') use examples.

**********************************************************Flutter SDK, API, and Environment Notes*******************************************************

Importing and loading packages-
Add package imports to the pubspec.yaml file and then underneath the ‘dependancies:’ list
You then need to get (load) these packages. You can either just save the yaml file in VScode which will automatically get the package, or run 
the following in your terminal
	flutter pub get
Then add an import statement for your package at the top of the main dart file.

State vs Stateless Widgets-
Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning their properties can’t change – All values are final.
Stateful widgets maintain a certain state but this state may change during the lifecycle of a widget. Implementing a stateful widget requires
at least two classes; 1) a StatefulWidget class that creates an instance of 2) a State class. The StatefulWidget class is, itself, immutable,
but the State class persists over the lifetime of a widget. 

Widget Catalog and Implementation Notes-
Here is the whole widget catalog  https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets
Here are just the Material Components Widgets (buttons and stuff which will likely be used the most) https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/material#Buttons

Some widget properties take a single widget(child) whereas other properties like 'action' can take a array of widgets (children) denoted by the 
square brakcets[].

Navigate to a new screen (programmatically)-
An app bringing up a new page, called a route in Flutter, is handled by the Navigator which manages a stack containing the app’s routes. Pushing 
a route onto the Navigator’s stack updates the display for that route. Popping a route from the Navigator’s stack returns the display to the previous 
route.
I used this guide to help me create state preserving navigation witht he bottom navbar

This article outlines another appraoch using a keyedSubTree and fader animations between pages!! (COOL!)

************************************************************ Helpful Git Commands **************************************************************
git checkout branchName
git stash   <-- stashes current changes so u can checkout a different branch
git stash pop   <-- unstash changes once youre back on the branch that has been stashed
git stash drop <stash id>     <-- delete specific stash given id number
git stash clear        <-- delete entire stash stack
git merge nameOfBranchToMergeIntoCurrentBranch
